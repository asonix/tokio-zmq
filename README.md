Currently Supported Sockets
 - REP
 - REQ
 - PUB
 - SUB
 - PUSH
 - PULL
 - XPUB
 - XSUB
 - PAIR
 - DEALER
 - ROUTER

See the [examples folder](https://github.com/asonix/zmq-futures/tree/master/examples) for usage examples.

### Getting Started

Add the following to your Cargo.toml
```toml
zmq = "0.8"
tokio-zmq = "0.4.0-alpha"
futures = "0.2.0-alpha"
tokio = "0.1"
```

In your application:
```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::convert::TryInto;

use futures::{FutureExt, StreamExt};
use tokio_zmq::prelude::*;
use tokio_zmq::{Rep, Socket};

fn main() {
    let ctx = Arc::new(zmq::Context::new());
    let rep: Rep = Socket::builder(ctx)
        .bind("tcp://*:5560")
        .try_into()
        .unwrap();

    let (sink, stream) = rep.sink_stream().split();

    let runner = stream
        .map(|multipart| {
            // handle the Multipart
            // This example simply echos the incoming data back to the client.
            multipart
        })
        .forward(sink);

    tokio::runtime::run2(runner.map(|_| ()).or_else(|e| {
        println!("Error: {:?}", e);
        Ok(())
    }));
}
```

### Running the examples
The `req.rs` and `rep.rs` examples are designed to be used together. The `rep` example starts a server with a REP socket, and the `req` example queries that server with a REQ socket.

The `zpub.rs` and `sub.rs` examples should be used togheter. `zpub` produces values that `sub` consumes.

The `push.rs`, `pull_push.rs`, and `pull.rs` files should be used together. `push` produces values, which are relayed by `pull_push` to `pull`, which consumes them and sends a stop signal to itself and to `pull_push`.

`sync_pubsub.rs`, `dealer_router.rs`, and `load_balancing_broker` are all self-contained, and spawn multiple threads.
