See the [examples folder](https://github.com/asonix/zmq-futures/tree/master/examples) for usage examples.

### Getting Started

Add the following to your Cargo.toml
```toml
zmq = "0.8"
tokio-zmq = "0.1.0"
futures = "0.1"
tokio-core = "0.1"
```

In your application:
```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::convert::TryInto;

use futures::Stream;
use tokio_core::reactor::Core;
use tokio_zmq::{SinkSocket, Socket, StreamSocket, Error};
use tokio_zmq::Rep; // the socket type you want

fn main() {
  let mut core = Core::new().unwrap();
  let handle = core.handle();
  let context = Rc::new(zmq::Context::new());
  let rep: Rep = Socket::new(context, handle)
      .bind("tcp://*:5560".into())
      .try_into()
      .unwrap()

  let runner = rep.stream()
      .and_then(|multipart| {
          // handle the multipart (VecDeque<zmq::Message>)
          // This example simply echos the incoming data back to the client.
          Ok(multipart)
      })
      .forward(rep.sink::<Error>());

  core.run(runner).unwrap();
}
```
