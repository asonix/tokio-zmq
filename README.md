[documentation](https://docs.rs/tokio-zmq/0.1.0/tokio_zmq/)
[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/tokio-zmq)

This crate contains wrappers around ZeroMQ Concepts with Futures.

Currently Supported Sockets
 - REP
 - REQ
 - PUB
 - SUB
 - PUSH
 - PULL
 - XPUB
 - XSUB
 - PAIR
 - DEALER
 - ROUTER

See the [examples folder](https://github.com/asonix/zmq-futures/tree/master/examples) for usage examples.

### Getting Started

Add the following to your Cargo.toml
```toml
zmq = "0.8"
tokio-zmq = "0.1.3"
futures = "0.1"
tokio-core = "0.1"
```

In your application:
```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::convert::TryInto;

use futures::Stream;
use tokio_core::reactor::Core;
use tokio_zmq::prelude::*;
use tokio_zmq::{Socket, Error};
use tokio_zmq::Rep; // the socket type you want

fn main() {
    let mut core = Core::new().unwrap();
    let handle = core.handle();
    let context = Rc::new(zmq::Context::new());
    let rep: Rep = Socket::new(context, handle)
        .bind("tcp://*:5560")
        .try_into()
        .unwrap()

    let runner = rep.stream()
        .and_then(|multipart| {
            // handle the multipart (VecDeque<zmq::Message>)
            // This example simply echos the incoming data back to the client.
            Ok(multipart)
        })
        .forward(rep.sink::<Error>());

    core.run(runner).unwrap();
}
```

### Running the examples
The `req.rs` and `rep.rs` examples are designed to be used together. The `rep` example starts a server with a REP socket, and the `req` example queries that server with a REQ socket.

The `zpub.rs` and `sub.rs` examples should be used togheter. `zpub` produces values that `sub` consumes.

The `push.rs`, `pull_push.rs`, and `pull.rs` files should be used together. `push` produces values, which are relayed by `pull_push` to `pull`, which consumes them and sends a stop signal to itself and to `pull_push`.

`sync_pubsub.rs` and `dealer_router.rs` are each self-contained, and spawn multiple threads.
