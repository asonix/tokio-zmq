//! This module contains the code that makes Tokio ZMQ Asynchronous. There's the `future` module,
//! which defines Request and Response futures for ZeroMQ Sockets, the `stream` module, which
//! defines receiving data from a socket as an asychronous stream, and the `sink` module, which
//! defines sending data to a socket as an asychronous sink.
